This directory contains the tool presented in the TACAS'20 paper entitled "Highly Automated Formal Proofs over Memory Usage of Assembly Code".
Our tool takes as input a binary and produces Isabelle 2018 code that contains a formal proof of memory preservation.
It has been used to generate the data of Figure 1 in the paper, as well as the experimental results in Section 4.

All the material supporting the paper, including the Xen proofs, can be found at:
